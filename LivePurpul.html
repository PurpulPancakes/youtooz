                    This is silly purple cat is known as Purpul! He loves to make friends, crack jokes, play video games, 
                    and of course, enjoy some pancakes! He is full of joy and always shares his positivity with the world 
                    in order to make it a better place! Purpul's fur is of course purple, and he is wearing his favorite 
                    oversized green long sleeve shirt, and he is also wearing his oversized pants! It's amazing how they 
                    even stay on, as if he has an invisible belt! With a nice and clean matte finish, he stands at 4.9 
                    inches tall and comes in a box themed after something that hasn't really been thought about yet, but 
                    it was put together by the Youtooz Artists in collaboration with PurpulPancakes himself! (Or he a 
                    Youtooz artist as well? Only time will tell! He is open to a job afterall!) This collectible ships in 
                    a matte, embossed outer protective sleeve.

                <p>
                    PurpulPancakes is a video game review channel that has started up fairly recently, he has been doing 
                    Youtube content for around 7 years now, and it's only recently he decided to start taking it a bit 
                    more seriously. His goal is to entertain people and help bring a lot more joy to the world! He enjoys 
                    playing video games and creating art, and making video game reviews is a great way to satisfy both needs! 
                    His editing style is constantly improving and he is always looking to make his content very enjoyable!
